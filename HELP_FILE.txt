needed to install pygame
for me, python 2.7 64-bit

pygame-1.9.2a0-cp27-none-win_amd64.whl
from
http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pygame

rename the whl (wheel) file to a zip (note, "pip install xxx.whl" should work, but it diudnt for me)

follow this kid's tutorial:

* dont need to double copy the headers, or copy the dist-info directory (or edit the WHEEL file)
